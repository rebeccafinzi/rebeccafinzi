## Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio! :wave:
Hi there! I'm a Data Science Master's student, and I'm excited to share my projects with you. In this repository, youâ€™ll find a collection of projects from both my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s studies.

Iâ€™ve uploaded various works that showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. These projects highlight the journey I've taken to improve my knowledge in data science, so feel free to explore, provide feedback, and connect!
